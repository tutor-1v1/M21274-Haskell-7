This file consists of the data that you should use in your Haskell program.

Your program should not process this file directly; rather, it needs to process
a Haskell list containing the data given in this file.

After you have worked out a suitable City datatype you should include the data
from this file (without any modifications or additions to the values) in your program 
as a value of type [City]; i.e.:

  testData :: [City]
  testData = [ ... the 10 City values ... ]

This data will be used to demonstrate the correctness of your program in the 
in-class demonstration (using the demo function). 

If you manage to complete loading and saving of data, make sure that the 
testData list value is also stored (without any modifications or additions) 
in a cities.txt file. Regardless of whether you have implemented a user
interface or loading/saving, make sure that you also complete the demo 
function in your program.

The data for each city includes a name, a location expressed in degrees north 
and degrees east, and a list of population figures in thousands (where the 
first value is for this year, the second value is for last year, and so on).
